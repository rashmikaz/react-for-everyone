## Setting Up

Before you start building React apps, you need to set up your development environment. This section will guide you through creating your first React project and running it locally.

There are a few common ways to start a React project. In small demos or learning scenarios, you can include React directly in your HTML using a CDN (Content Delivery Network). This is quick and requires no setup, but itâ€™s not suitable for real projects and lacks modern development tools.

For full-fledged projects, the traditional approach is Create React App (CRA). Released in 2016, CRA automatically generates a complete React project with all necessary configurations, letting developers focus on building the app instead of spending time setting up tools like Webpack or Babel.

The modern approach is using Vite, a lightweight and fast alternative to CRA. Vite offers instant server start, hot module replacement, and minimal configuration, making it ideal for modern React projects.
