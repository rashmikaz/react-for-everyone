## Setting Up

Before you start building React apps, you need to set up your development environment. This section will guide you through creating your first React project and running it locally.

There are a few common ways to start a React project. In small demos or learning scenarios, you can include React directly in your HTML using a CDN (Content Delivery Network). This is quick and requires no setup, but itâ€™s not suitable for real projects and lacks modern development tools.

For full-fledged projects, the traditional approach is Create React App (CRA). Released in 2016, CRA automatically generates a complete React project with all necessary configurations, letting developers focus on building the app instead of spending time setting up tools like Webpack or Babel.

The modern approach is using Vite, a lightweight and fast alternative to CRA. Vite offers instant server start, hot module replacement, and minimal configuration, making it ideal for modern React projects.

## Requirements for Creating a React Project

Before you can create a React project using Create React App (CRA), Vite, or any modern setup, you need the following tools installed on your system:

###### 1. Node.js

- React requires Node.js because it comes with npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn, which are used to install dependencies.
- Recommended version: Node 18+.

###### 2. Package Manager (npm or Yarn)

- npm comes with Node.js.
- yarn is an alternative package manager that can also be used to manage dependencies.

###### 3. Code Editor

- Use a text editor like VS Code for editing React code.
- VS Code supports JSX syntax highlighting, extensions, and debugging tools.

###### 3. Web Browser

- Modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge are required to view and test your React apps.
